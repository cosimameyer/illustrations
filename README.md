<details><summary>ALT</summary>Image showing how a general function in R looks like (a function has arguments, a function statement, and usually a return function). Good practices when writing functions are: 
Use meaningful names for your functions. It‚Äôs good to use verbs for functions.
Make your function short and simple - each function should do one thing at a time
Use an explicit return statement
Writing assertions, warnings and stops is helpful</details>

## NLP

### Terms and concepts
<img src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/nlp/CS_Terms_purple.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/nlp/CS_Terms_purple.png" width="500" height="700" />

<details><summary>ALT</summary>Image showing a visual overview of terms and concepts explaining a corpus, tokens, tokenization, DFM, stemming, and lemmatization. The verbalized version is in the text below:
Corpus: When you have your text data ready, you have your corpus. It‚Äôs a collection of documents. 
Tokens: Define each word in a text (but it could also be a sentence, paragraph, or character).
Tokenization: When you hear the word tokenization, it means that you are splitting up the sentences into single words (tokens) and turning them into a bag of words. You can take this quite literally - a bag of words does not really take the order of the words into account. There are ways to account for the order using n-grams (so for instance a bigram would leave the sentence "Rory lives in a world of books" as "Rory lives", "lives in", "in a", "a world", "world of", "of books") but it‚Äôs limited.
Document-feature matrix (DFM): To generate the DFM you first split the text into its single terms (tokens), then count how frequently each token occurs in each document.
Stemming: With stemming, you are getting the stem of the word.
Lemmatization: With lemmatization, it‚Äôs slightly different. Instead of "stud" (which is the stem of the study terms), you end up with a meaningful stem - "study"</details>

### BERT 
<img src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/nlp/BERT_BoW_purple.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/nlp/BERT_BoW_purple.png" width="700" height="500" />

<details><summary>ALT</summary>Image showing two different workflows (Bag of words and BERT). The main difference is that with BERT you build upon a pre-trained model and tokenizer while with BOW you often have to train a model from scratch.</details>

<img src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/nlp/Train_BERT_purple.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/nlp/Train_BERT_purple.png" width="700" height="500" />
  
<details><summary>ALT</summary>Image showing three important components to know when training a BERT model.
First, with BERT, you identify the order of the input. You give the model information about different embedding layers (the tokens (BERT uses special tokens ([CLS] and [SEP]) to make sense of the sentence), the positional embedding (where each token is placed in the sentence), and the segment embedding (which gives you more info about the sentences to which the tokens belong).
And then there is the training:
The first half of the training involves masking the words (Mask ML). During the training period, you mask one word at a time and the model learns, which word usually follows.
During the second half, you train the model to predict the next sentence. This way, the model learns which sentences usually follow each other.</details>

These visualizations are also available in *blue*:

## Explainable AI/ML

<img src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/explainable-machine-learning/explainable_ai.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/explainable-machine-learning/explainable_ai.png" width="700" height="500" />

<details><summary>ALT</summary>
The visualization of six different model agnostic approaches to explain machine learning models post-hoc such as

- **Feature importance**: Feature importance is based on the idea of permutation where you shuffle the values of a feature. If this change increases the model error, the feature is perceived to be important.
- **Shapley value**: Shapley values are based on a game theoretical approach that calculates the average of *all* marginal contributions to *all* possible outcomes.
- **LIME**: LIME plots tell you locally around a data point what the most important feature is. While they may look similar to SHAP, they are only an approximation (calculated on a small set of features and do not provide a guarantee of accuracy and consistency.
- **ICE**: ICE plots show the individual conditional expectation where all other features are kept the same and the effects for one feature are calculated.
- **Partial dependence**: Partial dependency plots visualize the *average* output of the model for each target feature value for the entire dataset.
- **Breakdown plot**: Breakdown plots show the contribution of every variable to the final prediction.</details>

<img src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/explainable-machine-learning/integrated_gradients.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/cosimameyer/illustrations/blob/main/explainable-machine-learning/integrated_gradients.png" width="700" height="500" />
  
<details><summary>ALT</summary>
The visualization shows the logic of integrated gradients. You start with your baseline which does not have any effect on the model classification and continue stepwise using linear interpolation to get to the original input. On the way, you calculate the model's prediction, compare it to the baseline, and derive the integrated gradients for each input feature by summing up the results of these calculations.

## Amazing Women

The following illustrations are part of a larger project ("Amazing Women in Tech") in which I aim to make women more visible in the world of programming, statistics, and STEM in general. The illustrations are shared along with a short portrait on social media such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=makingwomenmorevisible) and Mastodon.
